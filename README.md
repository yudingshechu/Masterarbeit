# Masterarbeit
Here are part of the code and current sample of my master thesis. This project/thesis will be finished with R and Python, using Uganda National Household Survey data and other open source data. 

My master thesis focuses on finding a robust Machine Learning model to predict the food insecurity events when facing a shock, such as the breakout of Covid and the war in Ukraine. 

## Climate data 
Climate data are exported from [NASA POWER](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/), and the Uganda map data are downloaded from [HDX--Uganda - Subnational Administrative Boundaries](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-uga?)
